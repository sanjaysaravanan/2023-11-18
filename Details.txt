Database:
  A database is an organized collection of structured/unstructured information, or data, 
  typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually 
  controlled by a database management system (DBMS).

  SQL --> Structured Query Language
    Language used to structurallly design the database, & query the database which responds with data

  Eg: Design a DB for Facebook sort of application,
    Classify the entities or objects in the database

    Data invovled in facebook, 
      what are the groups of data that being used in Facebook,
        1. Users ---> id, Profile Picture, Name, DOB, BIO
        2. Friends ---> User Id, email, friend_since, frind_id
        3. Posts ---> post_id, vidoe/image, likes (number), comments( this is also group )
        4. Comments ---> user_id, datetime, string, post_id
        5. Ads --> name, image, link, genre of the ads

  Table:
    represents the collections of single object
      eg:
       books is table which will contain multiple books:

        Name          Author     PublisheDate  Likes
        Harry Potter  JK          2023         1000
        Wings Of Fire APJ         2021         699

        todos

    datatypes in sql
    basic types 
      varchar(size) - string, 
      INT(size), 
      FLOAT(size, d), 
      DATE
      BLOB(size) / TEXT (CDN URL)- images/vidoes
        usually not suggested to used because of the uncertain size and type of the media which can load the DB size.
        Preferred way is CDN ( Content Delivery Network ) which can serve the images or videos hover internet

  Structuring of Data --> Design the Relationship between objects or entities

  Relational DB:

    Data / Objects are related together.

  Entity Relationship between tables/objects,
    one-to-one
    one-to-many (user ---> friends)
    many-to-one (friends ---> user)
    many-to-many ( rare scenario )
  
  Prime Video Objects:

    Movie --> name, storyline, genre, year, directors, producers, stars


    Stars:
      id    name      gender   noOfMovies
      1     SRK       Male      100
      2     Ranveer   Male      30

    genre table
      id, name,              description
      1   suspense           Sudden Twist in the plot
      2   Drama              Melodramatic in the plot


    Movie-Genres ( Linking table or the relating table )
      id movie-id genre-id
      1    1        1
      2    1        2

    Casting:
      id ( Primary key)
      movie_id ( Foreign_key --> primary key of some other table )
      star_id

      id    movie-id    star-id
      1       1          1
      2       1          2

    Movie:
      id -- movie id ( Primary Key )
      name --> string varchar
      storyline --> string varchar
      

      Id Name                Story-Line
      1  Jack Ryan           Detective Thriller

  Relationship between Objects:

    1. Primary key
    2. Foreign_key
  

  Eg:
    School/College maintaining students/teachers data in structured manner 
    like below,
      Student:
        student_id ( int ) - Primary key
        student_name (  )
        student_class/year
        student_department
        class_teacher ( Teacher Id - Foreign_key)
      Teacher:
        teacher_id ( Primary key )
        teacher_name
        teacher_subject
      Subjects:
        name
        id (primary key)
        teacher ( teacher_id ) ( FOREIGN KEY )
      Marks:
        subject_id ( FOREIGN KEY )
        mark
        mark_id (primary key)
        student_id ( FOREIGN KEY )

      Relationship between the teacher and student,
        teacher ---> students (one to many)
      
      Subjects & Teacher,
        teacher ---> subjects
        one - to - one
      
      Marks and Subjects:
        Marks --> subjects, students (many to many)

        Linking Table - Evaluation as Table 

    Train Ticket Booking,
      Train:
        train_number
        train_name
        train_status
      Customers:
        cust_id
        cust_name
        cust_email
        cust_phone
      Bookings: (Tickets)
        pnr
        customer_id (foreign_key)
        seats
        tain_number (foreign_key)
        date

    Customers, Products, Orders related Cart_id/customer_id (), Cart ( multiple entries of product with same cart_id )

DBMS:
  Database Management System is a software application/service used to 
  manage the operations( CRUD ) in the DB.

MySql:
  MySQL is a Structural database management system.

MySql Engine:
  A storage engine is a software module that a database management system uses 
  to do create, read, update data in a database.

list DB; 

create table

  rows(inserted, updated, deleted) ( data ), columns(alter) ( specification of the type of data )

  CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentId int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Class int,
  );

ALTER TABLE:
  statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
  ALTER TABLE table_name
  ADD column_name datatype;

  ALTER TABLE table_name
  DROP COLUMN column_name;

CRUD --> CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE

READ:
  select:
    all data
      SELECT * FROM movies;

    single column
      SELECT title FROM movies;

    multiple columns
      SELECT title, director FROM movies;

    limit:
      order and limit the enteries
    offset:
      where to start the limit count

  distinct:
